# TODO

Multiple purchases of one unit of tax free products
Override hashCode in Purchase, refactor equals override
Write tests for Purchase: is the regex expr valid for all the cases of the exercise?
How do I properly parse a double from a string into a BigDecimal?
Deal with plurals when building purchases? "1 book at...", "3 books at"
